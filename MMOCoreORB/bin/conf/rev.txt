22bd764 was R. Bassett Jr. (Tatwi), 3 weeks ago, message: [Add Feature] Hondo Housing System - A site-centric system that allows administrators to easily create player housing anywhere. - Sites contain a number of plots and each plot is home to one structure. Players use a terminal at the site to purchase a structure. - Over 20 pre-defined site layouts (that are easy to customize!). - Contains a building tour system so players can see them first hand before making their purchase. - Enable the "simple" planet and teleport to 1000x 1000y to see a demonstration city that was created using this system. - Full documentation is located in doc/features/add-housingsystem.md
