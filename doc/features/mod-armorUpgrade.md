###Armor Upgrade

A multi-pronged approach to making all armor types genuinely useful and as enjoyable as possible.

####Highlights
- All crafted armor types can have the same stats, more or less.
- One segment type is used by all armor (along with an optional upgraded version).
- Looted armor, reward armor, and aromr purchased from an NPC Merchant can be upgraded using a crafted segment, an Armor Upgrade Kit, and a crafting station.
- Slicing takes one vulnerability and makes it into a special resist, rather than changing Encumberance or Resistance values.
- Converted several cool helmets to have armor stats so they can be useful while looking cool.
- Many nifty quest items have armor stats, so they can be useful while looking all nifty and junk.
- All armor can be recolored using the radial menu (including colors 2 and 3).

####Uninversal Armor Segments
- The main segment for all crafted armor types.
- Has Kinetic and Energy as "Special Resists".
- Obtained at Artisan Domestics I.
- Required: 50 Steel, 25 Polymer, 25 Fiberplast.
- Optional: 3 Armor Layers, 1 Segment Enhancement.

####Advanced Uninversal Armor Segments
- An upgraded segment for use in all crafted armor types, designed to be hard to obtain.
- Has Kinetic and Energy as "Special Resists".
- Obtained at Master Armorsmith.
- Small stat uprade over the normal segment, so it isn't *required*, just nice to have and worth the effort.
- Required: 250 Titanium Aluminum, 250 Chanlon Intrusive Ore, 150 Yavin4 Mamal Bones, 1 Giant Dune Kimogila Scale, 1 Gurk King Hide.
- Optional: 1 Geonosian Power Cube, 3 Armor Layers, 1 Segment Enhancement.
- Giant Dune Kimogila Scale: Possible drop from any Kimogila and adds some condition to the armor without adding encumberance. Drops in smaller quantity.
- Gurk King Hide: Adds some condition to the armor without adding encumberance. Drops in smaller quantity.

####Armor Layers
- Each of the cafted layer types can also have a looted Segment Enhancement. 
- Using layers with looted parts is fundimental to building the best possible armor.
- Using layers always adds encumberance, but it is possible to reduce the encumberance with looted parts.

####Armor Pieces
- Only require one segement per piece, so each segment can be unique.
- Biceps and bracers have low encumberance, because they aren't optional when it's possible to wear them. That said, Layers and Segement Enhancements will add ecumberance that can't really be experimented away, due to the way the crafting system works. Keeping the encumberance low is a matter of using Nightsister Shards or low encumberance Janta Hide Segement Enhancements or Nightsister (Electricity) Layers.

####Crafted Armor Styles
- For the most part, all styles of armor can be used to equal effect, so you can wear the kind that you like (rather than the only kind with good stats).
- Each armor style has "Vulnerabilities" to everything except Kinetic and Energy, as well as one or two "Special Resists" unique to its style.
- The vulnerabilities are negated by using combinations of layers and looted parts.
- All armor types use the same crafting values as Composite Armor, resulting in a crafting process that is consistent no matter which style of armor is being made. Variation comes from the style "Special Resist", the resource requirements of the style, and what the crafter chose to put into the segment.
- Converted bone to use Armor Experimentation, but kept it granting General Crafting XP. Also moved it to the Domestics Artisan tree and spread it over the 4 boxes (Armorsmith needs Domestics 4 now, rather than Engineering 4).
- Converted RIS armor to use Universal Segments. Changed Giant Dune Kimo Scales in each armor piece to Reinforced Fiber Panel. Changed quest rewards (and dialog) to grant left/right bicep schematics rather than the RIS segment and RIS layers.

####Looted Parts
- Rebalanced and themed the parts so they each add something interestng when mixed/matched in layers and the final item. Loot pieces are required to make the best armor possible.
- Smaller values, due to being able to use loot parts in layers as well as the segment.
- Looted segments removed, as segement crafting is too important to be skipped.
- Nightsister Layer remains as an alternate Electricity Layer (a good one is better than what can be crafted).
- Encumberance values in Legend of Hondo are treated differently, which allows for each loot part to have a downside of Enc. without making the part/armor useless (high Enc. can be overcome with skillful play).

####Upgrading Armor
- This is a system I made to make all the armor styles useful, without having to make a huge client/server update to add new draft schematics to the game. 
- Crafting Stations made with 5 Droid Storage Modules have a 100 item input hopper that can store items.
- The Clothing and Armor Crafting Station has a new function called "Upgrade Armor".
- Requires 1 piece of armor, 1 Universal Armor Segment, and 1 Armor Upgrade Kit.
- Does not work with player crafted armor, but works with all other armor.
- The stats from the segement get added to the armor item.
- Crafting station and upgrade kit quality play a large roll in the quality of the final item (Good quality ones can add a bonus on top of the segment values).
- High quality crafting stations grant the chance to add up to 3 sockets. 
- An armor piece can only be upgraded once.
- To get the best possible stats, the upgrade process requires a piece of loot with resist stats around 45% or better, a Master Armorsmith to create the segment (with looted items and good resources), a Master Droid Engineer and Master Artisan to make good parts for the crafting station, and a Master Architect to make the crafting station itself.

####Skill Trees and Schematics
- Moved Armormsith to Domestics line of Artisan with Tailor.
- Universal Armor Segment granted at Artisan Domestics I.
- +10 Armorsmith Exp granted per 4 boxes of Artisan Domestics.
- Bone Armor converted to Armorsmith Assembly and Experimentation.
- Moved Armor Padding, Synthetic Cloth, and Reinforced Fiber Panels to Artisan Domestics IV.
- Crafting schematics granted for all armor types in the game directly in the Armorsmith profession.

####NPC Merchant and Quest Reward Armor
- In a later patch, all armor types in the game will available for purchase or as a reward from someone, somewhere.
- In this patch,the stats are similar to crafted armor of various qualities, depending on how easy the items will be to obtain.
- Sales and quests are gated and price adjusted based on the galactic faction system.
- Can be upgraded using the new process described above.

####Armor Slicing
- No longer increase armor stats or decrease encumberance values. 
- Now turns vulnerability into a special resist, matching either the best or worst existing resist value on the item.
