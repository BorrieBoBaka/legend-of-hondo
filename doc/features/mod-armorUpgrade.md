###Armor Upgrade

A multi-pronged approach to making all armor types genuinely useful and as enjoyable as possible.

####Highlights
- All crafted armor types can have the same stats, more or less.
- One segment type is used by all armor (along with an optional upgraded version).
- Looted armor, reward armor, and aromr purchased from an NPC Merchant can be upgraded using a crafted segment, an Armor Upgrade Kit, and a crafting station.
- All armor can have its Armor Rating upgraded from Light to Medium or Heavy.
- Slicing takes one vulnerability and makes it into a special resist, rather than changing Encumberance or Resistance values.
- Converted several cool helmets to have armor stats so they can be useful while looking cool.
- Many nifty quest items have armor stats, so they can be useful while looking all nifty and junk.
- All armor (and clothing) can be recolored using the radial menu (all possible areas).
- Armor and clothing color palette improvements.

####Uninversal Armor Segments
- The main segment for all crafted armor types.
- Has Kinetic and Energy as "Special Resists".
- Obtained at Artisan Domestics I.
- Required: 50 Steel, 25 Polymer, 25 Fiberplast.
- Optional: 3 Armor Layers, 1 Segment Enhancement.

####Advanced Uninversal Armor Segments
- An upgraded segment for use in all crafted armor types, designed to be hard to obtain.
- Has Kinetic and Energy as "Special Resists".
- Obtained at Master Armorsmith.
- Small stat uprade over the normal segment, so it isn't *required*, just nice to have and worth the effort.
- Required: 250 Titanium Aluminum, 250 Chanlon Intrusive Ore, 150 Yavin4 Mamal Bones, 1 Giant Dune Kimogila Scale, 1 Gurk King Hide.
- Optional: 1 Geonosian Power Cube, 3 Armor Layers, 1 Segment Enhancement.
- Giant Dune Kimogila Scale: Possible drop from any Kimogila and adds some condition to the armor without adding encumberance. Drops in smaller quantity.
- Gurk King Hide: Adds some condition to the armor without adding encumberance. Drops in smaller quantity.

####Armor Layers
- Each of the cafted layer types can also have a looted Segment Enhancement. 
- Using layers with looted parts is fundamental to building the best possible armor.
- Using layers usually adds encumberance, but it is possible to reduce the encumberance with looted parts.
- Added an Environmental Protection Layer for use while leveling. It main purposes is to make armor with low encumberance, at the cost of overall protection. It has a small amount of Kinetic and Energy resistance (3% Max) and up to 1% Armor Effectiveness. Designed to be used with "Tiny" looted armor segment enhancerments that also further reduce encumberance (but that's all they do). 

####Armor Pieces
- Only require one segement per piece, so each segment can be unique.
- Biceps and bracers have low encumberance, because they aren't optional when it's possible to wear them. That said, Layers and Segement Enhancements will add ecumberance that can't really be experimented away, due to the way the crafting system works. Keeping the encumberance low is a matter of using Nightsister Shards or low encumberance Janta Hide Segement Enhancements or Nightsister (Electricity) Layers.

####Crafted Armor Styles
- For the most part, all styles of armor can be used to equal effect, so you can wear the kind that you like (rather than the only kind with good stats).
- Each armor style has "Vulnerabilities" to everything except Kinetic and Energy, as well as one or two "Special Resists" unique to its style.
- The vulnerabilities are negated by using combinations of layers and looted parts.
- All armor types use the same crafting values as Composite Armor, resulting in a crafting process that is consistent no matter which style of armor is being made. Variation comes from the style "Special Resist", the resource requirements of the style, and what the crafter chose to put into the segment.
- Converted bone to use Armor Experimentation, but kept it granting General Crafting XP. Also moved it to the Domestics Artisan tree and spread it over the 4 boxes (Armorsmith needs Domestics 4 now, rather than Engineering 4).
- Converted RIS armor to use Universal Segments. Changed Giant Dune Kimo Scales in each armor piece to Reinforced Fiber Panel. Changed quest rewards (and dialog) to grant left/right bicep schematics rather than the RIS segment and RIS layers.

####Looted Parts
- Rebalanced and themed the parts so they each add something interestng when mixed/matched in layers and the final item. Loot pieces are required to make the best armor possible.
- Smaller values, due to being able to use loot parts in layers as well as the segment.
- Looted segments have been repurposed, as segement crafting is too important to be skipped. They are now intentionally non-stackable, single item drops and are used in the Armor Rating upgrade process.
- Encumberance values in Legend of Hondo are treated differently, which allows for each loot part to have a downside of Enc. without making the part/armor useless (high Enc. can be overcome with skillful play).

####Upgrading Armor
- This is a system I made to make all the armor styles useful, without having to make a huge client/server update to add new draft schematics to the game. 
- Crafting Stations made with 5 Droid Storage Modules have a 100 item input hopper that can store items.
- The Clothing and Armor Crafting Station has a new function called "Upgrade Armor".
- Upgrading armor is broken down into two different processes:

1. Quality: You improve the resistance and condition values.
2. Rating: You upgrade the armor rating from Light to Medium or Heavy.
		
The armor Quality upgrade process allows you to improve armor pieces that you have looted from enemies or purchased from Merchants. The Rating process, however, will function with any piece of armor.
		
*Quality Upgrade Requirements:*  
1 Armor Piece (non-player crafted)  
1 Armor Upgrade Kit  
1 Universal Armor Segment or 1 Advanced Universal Armor Segment  
				
Quality Tips:  
- Armor Resist values shown on the segment are added to those on the armor piece. Any Resist types that the armor does not already have will be added as Special Resists.
- Armor Encumberance values shown on the segment are added to those on the armor piece.
- Armor Integrity value shown on the segment is added to the condition on the armor piece.
- The final quality of the armor piece is effected by the Armor Effectiveness value shown on the segment, the Functionality Rating of the Clothing Crafting Station, and the Tool Effectiveness of the Armor Upgrade Kit.
- Max resist value is 80%, while Encumberance and Condition do not have a max values.
- Looted and Merchant armor do not have sockets for Skill Enhancing Attachments. The upgrade process might add up to 3 sockets.
- An armor piece can only be Quality upgraded once.
			
*Rating Upgrade Requirements:*  
1 Armor Piece  
1 Armor Upgrade Kit  
X number of identical of loot items  
		
Light to Medium:  
- Armor piece must have at least 65% Kinetic Resistance
- 500 Damage caused to the armor
- Need 10: brackaset plating segment, donkuwah bone armor segment, fambaa hide segment, kliknik chitin armor segment, sharnaff plating segment, voritor lizard hide segment
		
Medium to Heavy:  
- Armor piece must have at least 70% Kinetic Resistance
- 750 Damage caused to the armor
- Need 10: nightsister layer, rancor padded armor segment, woolamander harrower bone fragments
		
Any to Heavy:  
- Armor piece must have at least 75% Kinetic Resistance
- 1500 Damage caused to the armor
- Need 2: acklay hide, kimogila bone segment, kliknik reinforced chitin armor segment, krayt composite segment, peko albatross feather
		
Rating Tips:  
- Can be done more than once, but only until the armor is rated as Heavy.
- Failure consumes loot items and the armor upgrade kit, does not increase the armor rating, and causes 200 damage to the armor.
- Failure can be completely avoided by using a high quality Amor Upgrade Kit and Crafting Station.
- Increasing the Armor Rating allows the player to directly counter weapons with Armor Piercing ability, which are often found on very strong enemies. Generally speaking, for both players and non-players the system works like so,
- If Armor Rating is lower than Armor Piercing, you take more damage.
- If Armor Rating is the same as Armor Piercing, you take normal damage.
- If Armor Rating is higher than Armor Piercing, you take less damage.

####Skill Trees and Schematics
- Moved Armormsith to Domestics line of Artisan with Tailor.
- Universal Armor Segment granted at Artisan Domestics I.
- +10 Armorsmith Exp granted per 4 boxes of Artisan Domestics.
- Bone Armor converted to Armorsmith Assembly and Experimentation.
- Moved Armor Padding, Synthetic Cloth, and Reinforced Fiber Panels to Artisan Domestics IV.
- Crafting schematics granted for all armor types in the game directly in the Armorsmith profession.

####NPC Merchant and Quest Reward Armor
- In a later patch, all armor types in the game will available for purchase or as a reward from someone, somewhere.
- In this patch,the stats are similar to crafted armor of various qualities, depending on how easy the items will be to obtain.
- Sales and quests are gated and price adjusted based on the galactic faction system.
- Can be upgraded using the new process described above.

####Armor Slicing
- No longer increase armor stats or decrease encumberance values. 
- Now turns vulnerability into a special resist, matching either the best or worst existing resist value on the item.

####Color Palettes
- Almost all wearable items use the same palette (excluding weapons, backpacks, and some items that SOE made using inconsistent palette choices).
- Added a variety of non-drab color options.
- Portions of items that used to only have two white color options now also have the other colors as well.
