##Legend of Hondo Documentation

This directory contains documentation specific to Legend of Hondo. Here are some notes regarding its contents.

####Features_Log.md
The features log contains short a description of each group of content I have created. More detailed descriptions can be found in the doc/features directory.

####doc/features
Each file in this directory corresponds to a feature branch in the repo and contains a list of all files changed as well as description of what the changes do. These files are basically a combination of the commit log for each branch in a more verbose format and a blog post where I explain what I was creating, why I created it, and how it might be useful to other SWGEmu based projects.

####doc/guides
This is where you will find examples on how to use the new systems I have created. Rather than cluttering up the working files with verbose comments, I decided to make some guides here instead. That's not to say that the working files won't have comments, just that they won't have massive ones. I hope these guides will help people gain a better understanding of how things work within the Lua and C++ constructs of SWGEmu so that they too can have fun creating new things!
