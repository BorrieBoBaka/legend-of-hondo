###Legend of Hondo Features Log

This is a summary of the features I have posted. More detailed descriptions, along with any patch/fix notes, are located in the doc/features/ directory. 

####Admin Tools  
*Detailed Description: doc/features/add-admintools.md*  
*Last Patched On: 2016.09.21*  
A collection of modifications to aid in "world building" and assisting players with roleplay events. Tools range from automatic generation of screenplay calls (spawnMobile and spawnSceneObject) to a SUI list box that drops persistent structures into the world.

####Hondo Housing System  
*Detailed Description: doc/features/add-housingsystem.md* 
*Last Patched On: 2016.09.21*   
A site-centric system that allows administrators to easily create player housing anywhere. Sites contain a number of plots and each plot is home to one structure. Players use a terminal at the site to purchase a structure. Contains a building tour system so players can see them first hand before making their purchase.

####Breadcrumb Quest  
*Detailed Description: doc/features/add-breadcrumbquest.md*  
*Last Patched On: N/A*  
A simple example of a stand-alone quest that can be used as a template for other custom quests. The quest sends the player to a series of waypoints, ending back at the quest giver who then grants the player a reward.
