###ToDo List
An organized overview of my development priorities. Things I have already finished are not on this list.

####Fundamental

**Small Things:**  
- Done!

**Big Things:**  
- Pirate Missions, quests (story + 8 "theme parks"...), and dialog systems (bluff, beguile, lie, etc).
- Smuggling Missions
- Renown / Infamy System (Business Management System)

####Important

**Small Things:**  
- Done!

**Big Things:**  
- Add more tangible versions of static objects and make them available to the player for outdoor use
- Indoor and outdoor decor merchant(s) to make up for not being able to craft decorations and as a major "credit sink"
- Add more tangible versions of static objects and make them available to the player for outdoor use (this is a hugely tedious pain the ass)

####Less Important 
...things that I may or may not do.

**Small Things:**  
- Cap condemned fees at 3 months of fees and don't destroy condemned buildings
- Make the Armor Attachment list match Clothing Attachment list, so both can have all the same stats
- Add the Beast Master incubator from the NGE as a pretty crafting station for Bio-Engineer (because I like it!)

**Big Things:**  
- Roleplay based alternate travel system
- Scout Journal Exploration System
- Call your other characters as NPC "pets"
- New quests and stories
- Active townspeople AI, so cities feel more alive
- Merchants who sell limited use schematics (3 uses) and who will buy the end result items for 50% of the cost of the schematic.
- Womprat infestation dungeon
